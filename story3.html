    <h1 style="text-align: center;">THE KING WITH FOURTH WIVES</h1><br>






    <p>Once upon a time, there lived a king who had four wives. The king got seriously ill and was on his death bed.</p>

    <p>Afraid to venture into the afterlife alone, he asked his fourth wife whom he loved the most and bought her diamond, gold and elegant clothing — “Would you die with me? And go with me to the afterlife?” The fourth wife replied with a sorry saying she can’t do that and walked away</p>

    <p>He also loved his third wife and was very proud and would show her off to neighboring kingdoms. He called on his third wife and asked the same question — “Would you accompany me to the afterlife”? The third wife replied that she loved her life too much and she cannot go with him and also that she would remarry on his death.</p>

    <p>The second wife has always been there for him in the times of his need. So he asked her would she accompany him in the afterlife? The second wife apologetically replied that she would not be able to help him this time but would arrange his funeral and would be there for his funeral</p>

    <p>A voice called out and said that — “I will leave with you and follow you wherever you go, even if it is to the afterlife”. The king looked and it was his first wife. And this was the wife he took care of the least. He felt embarrassed and said that I should have taken a better care of you and given you more attention when I was alive.</p>
